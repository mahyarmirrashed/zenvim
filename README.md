# Zenvim

A minimal, reproducible Neovim configuration based on
[`kickstart-nix.nvim`](https://github.com/nix-community/kickstart-nix.nvim).

Relax knowing that Nix handles package management, and Lua handles
configuration.

> [!NOTE]

> Zenvim is a personal project and is not intended as a general-purpose Neovim

## ðŸš´ Test Drive

If you have Nix installed with flakes enabled, you can try Zenvim by running

```bash
nix run "github:mahyarmirrashed/zenvim"
```

This will launch Neovim with the Zenvim configuration. Use this as a starting
point to explore and customize.
